#Crystal hit energy spectrum

In this folder, you will find a simulated data (gm2ringsim_truth_2725k.root) with muon gas gun for the Muon g-2 experiment. In the root file, several histrogarms like the gas gun distribution and decay positron distribution are stored. 

ROOT macro
----------

ROOT macro _fitESpectrum.C_	can be used to fit the energy spectrum of each crystal in each calorimeter, 
_plot_xtalHitEnergyDist.C_ can be used to plot all the energy spectrum at once, 24 files, each for a calorimeter.
